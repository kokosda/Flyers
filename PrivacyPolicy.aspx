        <h2>Information We Gather</h2>
        <h6>Registration</h6>

        <p>If you register to buy or sell Services <a href="signup.aspx">using <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %></a>, we collect and store Personal Information that specifically identifies you or your Account. At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is your first name, last name, User ID, password, preferred currency, street address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, phone number, email address and valid financial Account information. Other information requested on our Registration page, including the ability to receive promotional offers from <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %>, is optional. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you to help us to tailor the Site for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our information with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. Credit card information is transmitted via SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption for your protection.</p>


        <h6>The <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> Payment System</h6>

        <p>The <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> Payment Service requires Members to pay with a credit card. <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information and will use to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process.</p>


        <h6>Automatically Gathered Information</h6>

        <p><%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> automatically collects browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of the Site and the Services to the Visitor’s or User’s platform and to maintain a record of the User’s or Visitor’s activity on the Site. <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track Visitor and User trends and patterns. Users and Visitors always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our Site may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an automatic process, our Web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access the Site. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users’ Personal Information. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms and Conditions of Use or to protect our service, Site, customers or others.</p>


        <h6>Email to Clients Feature and Referral Program</h6>

        <p><%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> lets you easily send email flyers to clients via email. <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> also offers the ability to send others emails about providing or purchasing Services through <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %>. If you choose to use either feature, be assured that <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %> only uses your these email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested email flyer. Your client's email addresses will be deleted from our database after the message is sent.</p>
        <h2>How We Use and Disclose Information</h2>
        <h6>Registration Information</h6>

        <p>We use Personal Information for our own internal purposes including contacting you via email to inform you about updates to our Services and providing you with information relating to e-commerce transactions that you conduct on the Site. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law. We do not rent or sell our Users' Personal Information to third parties. We do, however, provide you with the opportunity to receive newsletters via email. If you decide to opt in to receive newsletters, you may opt out of receiving these newsletters at any time by clicking on your Preferences and choosing Email Notifications to Unsubscribe.</p>


        <h6>Advertising</h6>

        <p>We may send you email communications including information that we think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these email communications either when you register to become a Member or via the Preferences section of your MyFlyers area. We do not send any of your Personal Information to our advertisers. You may see a cookie from a third-party banner server, and this cookie comes from the third-party banner server, not <%= clsUtility.ProjectName %>. Again, we do not pass along any Personal Information to this party.</p>


        <h6>Comments Submitted by Users</h6>

Submitting comments via email will not cause you to receive any secondary or promotional material, unless specifically requested by you. In certain circumstances, we may ask for your permission to post your comments in marketing or promotional materials.</p>


        <h6>Security</h6>

        <p>We will use commercially reasonable methods to keep Personal Information securely in our files and systems. Our Payment System is operated using secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to help protect your financial data.

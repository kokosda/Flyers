You agree to pay for any and all purchases and services made using your name and credit card through this Site, not to challenge any such charges and to pay for all collections and/or attorneys fees resulting from any non-payment.</p>
        <h6>ACCESS AND USE OF <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName.ToUpper() %></h6>
        <p>You agree that if you are issued a Username and Password by <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %>, you shall use your best efforts to prevent access to this site through your Username and Password by anyone other than yourself, including but not limited to, keeping such information strictly confidential, notifying <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> immediately if you discover loss or access to such information by another party not under your control and supervision, and by using a Username and Password not easily guessed by a third party. You agree to provide accurate and truthful information when creating your membership account and when creating any type of Email Flyers. Except as may be explicitly permitted through this site, you agree not to save, download, cut and paste, sell, license, rent, lease, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works from materials, code or content on or from this site. Systematic retrieval of data or other content from this site to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without written permission from <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> is prohibited. In addition, use of the content or materials for any purpose not expressly permitted in this Agreement is prohibited. You agree that you will only submit content for Email Flyers that contains your own name, your own property or properties and your own image or images. Before submitting any content for Email Flyers with more than one person's name, property or image, you must seek and receive specific written permission from that other person and present proof of the written permission to <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %>. Customer grants permission to <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> to distribute customer's Email Flyers to the Marketing Area(s) that were selected during the Email Flyer creation process. It is customer's responsibility to ensure Email Marketing is not against the policy of any Associations to which they may belong. Customer agrees to take full responsibility for content, including spelling and accuracy of information. No refunds will be made due to flyer content mistakes. Customer agrees that Customer is fully authorized to use any image uploaded to our server and/or used in the Email Flyer. Images created by any other person are not authorized unless licensed. It is the customer's sole responsibility to ensure they have proper authorization to use images in their Email Flyers. Hyperlinks must be used in accordance with their label. Hyperlinks to unrelated web pages are not permitted and may be removed without notice by <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> prior to distribution. <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> allows email flyer recipients to forward the flyer to their clients or peers. This hides the contact information of the original listing agent. You agree that this hiding of original listing agent's contact information is not a problem to you. We do our best to send all flyers on the date and time they are scheduled. We, however, cannot guarantee a flyer will be sent on the exact date and time you schedule it. The timing will depend on your own incoming e-mail service provider, un-expected server or computer problems that we have no control over and how many other flyers are scheduled for the date/time that your flyer is scheduled for. <%= clsUtility.SiteBrandName %> does not guarantee successful e-mail delivery to all e-mails in our lists or to any additional e-mails you place in your lists. Successful e-mail delivery depends greatly on the receivers e-mail settings and the internet provider of the receivers e-mail account. If a receiver blocks HTML e-mails or e-mails that have photos or if an internet provider has limitations on how much bulk e-mail can be received, the receiver may not receive the e-mail. We also do not guarantee that our lists will contain every licensed Realtors email address. If the Realtors email address is not made publicly available to us then we will not have them in our lists. We do, however, provide a guarantee that all e-mails will leave our server. Once they leave our server we have no control over them. We have features in place that allow us to determine if, when and how many e-mails a flyer was sent to, but we do not automatically add tracking features on who actually read or opened the e-mail unless you add the open tracking feature to your flyer. We do not guarantee any type of response or successful leads on any e-mail campaigns that are sent through our system. The response you receive will depend greatly on the property or service you are offering and if it appeals to the receiver. The response success may vary greatly from one flyer to another. Email Flyers must be scheduled for delivery within 3 months of purchase. Unused Email Flyers will expire after a 3-month period. Refunds will not be given for expired Email Flyers.</p>
